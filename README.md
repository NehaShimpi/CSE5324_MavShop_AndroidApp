# CSE5324_MavShop_AndroidApp
▪ App Title:- MAV$HOP

▪ App Description:- We plan to create an app which will facilitate students to sell or
buy items when moving in/moving out of the campus.

Problems:- When students come to stay on-campus, they need necessary materials like
a table,chairs,microwave etc. Similarly,when students move out of the campus they sell
the items which are unnecessary to them.

Solution:- It would be easy for students to perform buying and selling items through an
app. Also, students will get the items at cheap rates and this app will be within UTA
students only.

a. Function 1:- User-Registration - User will register with student email address and fill
out all the necessary details required.

b. Function 2:- Categorize Items - User will view the items divided into categories. All the
items will be organized for easy access.

c. Function 3:- Item Details -User who wishes to sell an item will fill in description,
upload pictures and enter the desired price.

d. Function 4: - Direct to payment -User selects the item and would proceed for
payment. Payment page will accept card details of the user.
